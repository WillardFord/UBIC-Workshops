# UBIC-Workshops
A collection of materials used in Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC) workshops at UCSD.

Each folder corresponds to a 90 min workshop that UBIC at UCSD hosted. They are all independent and require no knowledge of each other. The order they were prepared and presented is as follows:

1. RNA Seq - Differential Expression Analysis
2. Population Genomics - Principal Component Analysis of genetic variants
3. Assembly Algorithms - de Brujin graphs assembly
